                <dd>He accelerates his blood pressure by compressing his legs or hands ,<br>his body starts steaming,his body turns red and his
                    speed increses.He figured it out during his fight with the cp9 in water 7.He first used it during the eniss lobby arc.
                    it enabled him to keep up with rob lucci six path powers he also defeted earlier bruno of cp9 </dd>
<dt><h4>Gear three</h4></dt>
<dd>In this gear he increases the size of his body parts, this enables him to land an attack/blow with a great force and speed that over whelms his opponents.
To get into gear 3 he puntures his thumb and inflates his body.He discovered this during water 7 also and he used it to defeat rob lucci at eniss lobby arc.
He used it at first to destroy a door while chasing after lucci and spartum to save Nico robin whom they were taking to the gates of justice.
At first it was shown to have side effects as he turned to a child, which is disadvantageous in a fight as he becomes vulnarable as it take time to
 return to his normal size but has recently it seems he has overcome this effect.
